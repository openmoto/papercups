# Papercups Fork Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project plan outlines the steps to customize and maintain a fork of the Papercups open-source customer chat platform. The original project (papercups-io/papercups) is no longer actively maintained, so our fork will address several key issues and implement improvements to make it a viable long-term solution.

## Current Issues

1. **Subscription System**: The "Upgrade your subscription" feature points to the now-defunct papercups.io payment infrastructure.
2. **Email Forwarding**: The email forwarding feature generates addresses at chat.papercups.io, which is no longer operational.
3. **Security Concerns**: Unmaintained dependencies and potential security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates.

## Project Goals

1. Remove dependencies on external papercups.io services
2. Implement our own email forwarding solution
3. Update dependencies and address security concerns
4. Customize the application for our specific needs
5. Establish a maintenance process for long-term viability
